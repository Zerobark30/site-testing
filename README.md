 To launch the application:

 - Open the index file in a browser, all other files are either referenced by that file or can be navigated to from 
 that page

 - To see the main.js file at work, go to the Cameron's pizzeria link on the first page

Changes made to portfolio:

 - In-lined css file

 - Changed google font to only render for media above a certain pixel width

 - added async tag to perfmatters

 - Compressed image sizes

 - Used gulp to compress other files (this didn't actually change that much and I don't think it matters because I in-lined the css anyway, but it was a part of my process)

 Changes to main.js :

 - Took some calculations out of the for loop for updatePositions (var topPos)

 - Reduced the number of pizzas over with the for loop was run

 - added back-face visibility: hidden to css file under mover class
